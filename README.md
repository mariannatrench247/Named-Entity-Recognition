This trained Named Entity Recognition (NER) model is designed to identify and classify named entities in text. 

This means it can recognize specific types of words or phrases, such as:

Persons (PER) → Identifies names of people
Organizations (ORG) → Identifies companies, institutions, brands, etc.
Locations (LOC) → Recognizes cities, states, countries, and other locations
Miscellaneous (MISC) → Captures other significant named entities that don’t fit into the main categories
